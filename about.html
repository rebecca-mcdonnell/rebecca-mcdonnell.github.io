        I moved to <strong>St. Catharines</strong> this fall and I’m genuinely excited to be in the
        <strong>Niagara region</strong> — the water, the green spaces, and that “new chapter” feeling
        you get when a place starts to feel like home.
      </p>

        I’m naturally curious and a little obsessed with small details, which is probably why rock collecting
        stuck so quickly. It started as something calming and fun… and then I blinked and suddenly I had
        a whole collection (and a camera roll full of “look at this one!!”).
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is where I share my finds, creative projects, and little updates as I explore Niagara.
        Some stones are available for purchase, others are just here to be appreciated — either way, every
        piece has a story behind it.
