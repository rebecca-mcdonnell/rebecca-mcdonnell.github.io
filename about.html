  </div>Hi, I’m Rebecca — a rock-loving, cat-obsessed nature wanderer based in Ontario.
I spend my time beach-combing, rock-hounding, and finding small moments of joy in the everyday. From fossilized wood and agates to quiet shoreline mornings, this space is where I share what I find, what I learn, and what makes me smile.
When I’m not outside, I’m usually at home with my cats (Olive, Puzzle, Finn, Nala, and Smokey), documenting finds, or working on creative projects.
This site is a growing collection of rocks, stories, and slow moments — welcome 🤍
